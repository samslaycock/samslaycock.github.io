							<h4>Apollo 1</h4>
							
							<p>The Apollo program changed forever on Jan. 27, 1967, when a flash fire swept through the Apollo 1 command module during a launch rehearsal test. The three men inside perished despite the best efforts of the ground crew. It would take more than 18 months, and extensive redesigns, before NASA sent more men into space.</p>

							<h4>Apollo 2</h4>
							
							<p>Apollo-Saturn 203 (AS-203) is sometimes referred to as Apollo 2. It was an unmanned mission that was launched on July 5, 1966 and was destroyed about six hours into the flight though it managed to orbit four times.  The main purpose of its flight was to investigate the effects of “weightlessness” on the fuel in the S-IVB tank. It was this particular tank that the Apollo astronauts planned to use to boost them up from the earth’s orbit and towards the moon. </p>

							<h4>Apollo 3</h4>
							
							<p>Space mission Apollo-Saturn 202 (AS-202) or informally known as the Apollo 3 was launched on August 25, 1966. It was a sub-orbital test flight that lasted for only an hour and a half. The mission was to test the rocket for its capacity to stay longer in orbit than Apollo 2 did. The plan was to launch it higher by firing the engine four times during the flight while testing the functionality of its command and service module.</p>

							<p>Space mission Apollo 4, also known as Apollo-Saturn 501 (AS-501) was an unmanned flight which orbited three times and lasted for about eight and a half hours. It was launched on November 9, 1967 from the John F. Kennedy Space Center. The mission was to test the complete Apollo command and service module which stages are all functional. It tested for the capacity of the module’s heat shield by reproducing the lunar return speed of 25,000 miles per hour. </p>

							<h4>Apollo 5</h4>
							
							<p>The launch vehicle for Apollo 5 was the Saturn IB, a smaller rocket than the Saturn V but capable of launching an Apollo spacecraft into Earth orbit. The Saturn IB SA-204 used on Apollo 5 was the one originally intended for Apollo 1.[4] It had been undamaged in the fire at Launch Complex 34 and was reassembled at Launch Complex 37B for the Apollo 5 launch.</p>

The mission lasted for about 10 hours and despite the malfunctions, it proved to NASA that a manned spaceflight is a possibility. The primary objective of this space mission was to qualify the vessel’s design for a manned flight.</p>

							<h4>Apollo 7</h4>
							
							<p>Apollo 7 (AS-205), the first manned Apollo flight, lifted off from Launch Complex 34 at Cape Kennedy Oct. 11, carrying Walter M. Schirra, Jr., Donn F. Eisele, and R. Walter Cunningham. The countdown had proceeded smoothly, with only a slight delay because of additional time required to chill the hydrogen system in the S-IVB stage of the Saturn launch vehicle. Liftoff came at 11:03a.m. EDT.</p>

							<h4>Apollo 8</h4>
							
							<p>On December 21, 1968, just a few months after the launching of Apollo 7, space mission Apollo 8 followed and became the first manned spaceflight that reached the moon’s orbit and landed back to earth successfully. Its crew consisted of Frank Borman as the commander, James Lovell as the navigator, and William Anders as the flight engineer. They were the first people to witness the far side of the moon with their naked eyes while onboard the spacecraft. </p>

Its three-person crew consisted of Mission Commander Jim McDivitt, Command Module Pilot David Scott, and Lunar Module Pilot Rusty Schweickart. The objective of the mission was to test the several aspects of landing on the moon.</p>

							<p>The Apollo 10 was one of the most successful missions of the Apollo Space Program. It was an F-type mission of the series, denoting the fourth manned flight using a Command/Service Module (CSM) called ‘Charlie Brown’ and a Lunar Module (LM) called ‘Snoopy’. This spacecraft was composed of the first completed Apollo spacecraft configuration.</p>

							<h4>Apollo 11</h4>
							
							<p>Apollo 11 is the most renowned mission of the Apollo Space Program. It enabled man to land a spacecraft and walk on the Moon. Apollo 11 was the first G-type mission in history. It was followed later by Apollo 12 and 14. A G-type mission was one of the seven types of missions 640-721 in space that was characterized by a manned lunar landing. It was actually under the presidency of John F. Kennedy that these space missions materialized and occurred under a session of the US Congress. </p>

							<h4>Apollo 12</h4>
							
							<p>Because of the successful landing of Apollo 11, Apollo 12’s mission was expanded. This mission was modeled to achieve a precision landing. Other objectives of this mission were to collect samples and to set up experiments on the moon. The crew was also assigned to take still images of the moon’s surface. Apollo 12 was launched on November 14, 1969 four months after Apollo 11 at 11:22 AM EST. The launch site was the same as Apollo 11 which was at the Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex.</p>

							<h4>Apollo 13</h4>
							
							<p>Like Apollo 12, Apollo 13 was supposed to have a precision landing. Unfortunately, a problem with the oxygen tank occurred. Their oxygen tank burst which induced damage to their spacecraft. They were forced to abort their mission of precision landing and were only asked to orbit the moon. This was the first aborted mission of the Apollo Space Program. </p>

							<h4>Apollo 14</h4>
							
							<p>Because of the failed mission of Apollo 13, it had been a long while before they sent another mission to space—Apollo 14. Apollo 14 was the first H-type mission which was followed by Apollo 15. This mission involved a period of short stay on the moon’s surface. Its objectives included a detailed probe on the moon. There was a gap of ten months between the misfortune of Apollo 13 and Apollo 14, before it was launched on January 31, 1971 at 4:03 PM EST at the same launching pad the previous missions were launched.</p>

							<h4>Apollo 15</h4>
							
							<p>Apollo 15 was the eighth outstanding mission of the Apollo Space Program. It was the first advanced mission followed by two other more—the Apollo 16 and 17. Since this was an advanced mission, it included several experiments like: observing the lunar surface, surveying sample materials and features of the Hadley-Apennine region, conducting other experiments, and taking pictures.</p>

							<h4>Apollo 16</h4>
							
							<p>The success of the mission of Apollo 15 brought another J-class mission to the moon—the Apollo 16. The lunar probe, like the Apollo 15, lasted longer than three days. It also had three extra-vehicular activities. The aim of this mission was the same as the previous Apollo missions 640-802 including the first use of an ultraviolet camera on the Moon. Launched in April 16, 1972 at 12:55 PM EST, the Apollo 16 mission was planned to land on the Descartes highlands, an undiscovered region on the Moon.</p>
